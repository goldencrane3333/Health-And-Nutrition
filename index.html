            <p>Hello! My name is Faras Maroge and I am a nutrition expert. </p>
            <p>I have always thought that health and nutrition were the most important thing.</p>
            <p>Well, my friends, the truth is that you have to ask yourself:  What are nutrients?
Nutrients are ingredients in food that help you: Grow, repair body tissue, and build new muscle tissue. No single food will provide you with the right amount of nutrients. By combining foods from all the different food groups, you can meet your body's daily needs.</p>
            <p>How do I eat a healthy diet? Start by eating a variety of foods.  Choose foods that are low in fat and sugar. Choose and prepare foods that are low in salt. Learn to read and understand food labels.
            </p>

                    <h3>Do I need a vitamin and mineral supplement?</h3>
                    <p>Vitamins are present in different amounts in different kinds of food.
Minerals on the other hand, help your body carry out certain activities and are also present in many foods.  Usually all vitamins and minerals you need are in a well-balanced diet.
Some Vitamin or mineral supplements may be needed if your diet does not have a variety of foods from each group.  Most of them do not get absorbed by the body and you will need to know which companies are good.
